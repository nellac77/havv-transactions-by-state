# HAVV Transactions By State
Help America Vote Verification (HAVV) Transactions by State
2011 - Present (March 2024)

All this information and the data set itself is available through the [Social Security Administration](https://www.ssa.gov/open/havv/) (accessed on Wednesday, April 3, 2024, at approximately 10:07 AM).

## What is HAVA?
The [Help America Vote Act of 2002, P.L. 107-252](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/PLAW-107publ252/pdf/PLAW-107publ252.pdf) (HAVA) requires States to verify the information of newly registered voters for Federal elections. Each State must establish a computerized State-wide voter registration list and verify new voter information with the State’s Motor Vehicle Administration (MVA).

The States are required to verify the driver’s license number against the state MVA database. Only in situations where no driver’s license exists should the states verify the last four digits of the new voter registrant’s Social Security Number (SSN). The State submits the last digits of the SSN, name, and date of birth to the MVA for verification with SSA. In addition, SSA is required to report whether its records indicate that the registrant is deceased.

To ensure the privacy of the SSN, HAVA restricted the collection to only the last four digits of the SSN. HAVA provides that these last four digits do not constitute an SSN.

## What is HAVV?
To comply with the requirements of section 303 of HAVA, SSA developed a new verification system, known as the Help America Vote Verification (HAVV) system, in August 2004. States must only submit a request to us for new voters who do not present a valid driver’s license during the voter registration process. HAVV verifies the accuracy of the name, date of birth, and **last four** digits of SSN submitted and sends an indication of whether our records show the individual as deceased.

## Are all the States using the 4-digit HAVV system?
Forty-three states currently use HAVV. Although the 4-digit HAVV system is designed to track usage by all states and territories, the law does not require all states to use the system. Seven States are not using the 4-digit HAVV system.

* Five States (New Mexico, Kentucky, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia) are “grandfathered” under section 7 of the Privacy Act, and are permitted to use the 9-digit SSN on applications for voter registration. None of these states currently uses the 4-digit HAVV verification.
* North Dakota does not require voter registration and also does not use the system.
* In addition, neither the territories (the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, and the United States Virgin Islands) nor the District of Columbia, are using the 4-digit system.

## What does this data represent?
This data represents the results of the 4-digit match performed using our HAVV system. We operate HAVV as required by HAVA.

**Note:** Please address questions about the use of the system by any particular state to the appropriate voter registration official in that state.

## What do these terms mean?
The following list describes the types of data in the HAVV dataset.

1. **Total Transactions:** The total number of verification requests made during the time period.
2. **Unprocessed Transactions:** The total number of verification requests that could not be processed because the data sent to us was invalid, (e.g., missing, not formatted correctly).
3. **Total Non Matches:** The total number of verification requests where there is no match in our records on the name, last four digits of the SSN or date of birth.
4. **Total Matches:** The total number of verification requests where there is at least one match in our records on the name, last four digits of the SSN and date of birth.

7. **Multiple Matches Found - All Alive:** The total number of verification requests where there are multiple matches on name, date of birth, and last four digits of the SSN, and each match indicates the number holder is alive.
8. **Multiple Matches Found - All Deceased:** The total number of verification requests where there are multiple matches on name, date of birth, and the last four digits of the SSN, and each match indicates the number holder is deceased.
9. **Multiple Matches Found - At least one alive and at least one deceased:** The total number of verification requests where there are multiple matches on name, date of birth, and the last four digits of the SSN, and at least one of the number holders is alive and at least one of the number holders is deceased.
